# Cognitive Upgrades (2025)

NeuroxAI incorporates several "Human-Limit" cognitive modules designed to emulate higher-order reasoning, self-awareness, and social intelligence. These go beyond standard SNN capabilities.

## 1. Theory of Mind (`TheoryOfMind`)
This module allows the agent to simulate other agents' mental states.
*   **Mechanism**: It maintains shadow copies of the self-model, parameterized by observed behaviors of others.
*   **Function**: Enables prediction of social dynamics and cooperative planning.

## 2. Inner Dialogue (`InnerDialogue`)
Simulates the "stream of consciousness" or internal monologue.
*   **Multi-Perspective Deliberation**: The system generates multiple competing "thoughts" or potential responses.
*   **Arbitration**: A selection mechanism chooses the most coherent thought based on current goals and emotional state.

## 3. Metacognition (System 2)
Implements a supervisory attentional system that monitors the brain's own performance.
*   **Uncertainty Estimation**: If the primary cortical prediction error is high, Metacognition engages.
*   **Strategy Selection**: It can dynamically switch between "Fast" (heuristic, basal ganglia) and "Slow" (deliberative, cortical simulation) thinking modes.

## 4. Emotional State Machine
A continuous dynamical system representing the agent's affect.
*   **Core Dimensions**: Valence (Good/Bad) and Arousal (Calm/Excited).
*   **Impact**: Emotions are not just labels; they fundamentally alter simulation parameters.
    *   *High Arousal* -> Increases Norepinephrine (Focus, Exploration).
    *   *Negative Valence* -> Increases Serotonin (Patience, Withdrawal).
